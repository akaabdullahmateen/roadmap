# Product Design: Lecture 1    

## Product Experience

A product is experienced, ordinarily, on three dimensions:

- Utilitarian function
  : What does the product do, how does it do it, how well does it do it, is it comfortable, and is it durable?
- Emotional attitude
  : It's how a product strikes us when we see it. It can be supportive, it can even be arrogant, it can be tough, or it can be cute. 
- Cultural style
  : It's basically the style that the maker or buyer of the product identify with.

When the product connects with us on these three levels, we identify with it. It becomes an extension of our own identity. However, according to Christian Maats, there is one more dimension to product experience:

- Belief system
  : Meaningful products are based on a belief system that we can identify with, and they serve a purpose that we can empathize with. This belief system informs all other design decisions.

If a product aligns with our ideas of the function, the attitude, the style, and the belief system, we all want to have it. It becomes meaningful, and we want to support the people making this product. So the belief system is really the core behind all the activities and all the design decisions that you make as a product designer.

The belief system allows us to evaluate our activities: "*Are we doing what we believe we should be doing?*"

## Design Thinking Paradigm

The Double Diamond structure is used to understand customers and their problems, and explore creative and innovative ways to solve their problems and deliver them. Using the double diamond, we approach problems and solutions using two different types of thinking:

- Divergent thinking: Think broadly, keep an open mind, consider anything and everything.
- Convergent thinking: Think narrowly, bring back focus, and identify one or key problems and solutions.

There are four phases to the double diamond approach:

- Discover customer problems.
- Define specific customer problems.
- Develop potential solutions to these customer problems.
- Deliver feasible and viable solutions to these customer problems.
