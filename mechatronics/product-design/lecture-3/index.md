# Product Design: Lecture 3

## Human-Centered Design

### Definition

Human-centered design is an approach to interactive systems development that aims to make systems usable and useful by focusing on the users, their needs and requirements, and by applying human factors or ergonomics, and usability knowledge and techniques. This approach enhances effectiveness and efficiency, improves human well-being, user satisfaction, accessibility and sustainability, and counteracts possible adverse effects of use on human health, safety, and performance.

### Stages

Inspiration
: In this phase, you understand people. You observe their lives, hear their hopes and desires, and get smart on your challenge.
  
  - Research (primary, secondary)
  - Plan (time, place, explore)
  - Recruit (team, user group, volunteers)
  - Conversation starters
  - Story boards (rearrange)
  - Guided tours
  - Keep inspired
  - Think deep (immersion, find what's hidden)
  - Peer review
  - Draw it (mind maps, conceptual sketches)
  - Interviews (needs, desires)
  - Card sort

Ideation
: Here you make sense of everything that you've heard, generate tons of ideas, identify opportunities for design, and test and refine your solutions.

Implementation
: Now you bring your solution to life. You figure out how to get your idea to market and how to maximize its impact in the world.

### Requirements

Creative confidence
: Creative confidence is the notion that you have big ideas, and that you have the ability to act on them. (David Kelly, Founder, IDEO)

Make it
: You're taking risk out of the process by making something simple first. And you always learn lessons from it. (Krista Donaldson, CEO, D-Rev)

Learn from failure
: Don't think of it as failure, think of it as designing experiments through which you're going to learn. (Tim Brown, CEO, IDEO)

Empathy
: In order to get to new solutions, you have to get to know different people, different scenarios, and different places. (Emi Kolawole, Editor-in-Residence, Stanford University d.school)

Embrace ambiguity
: We want to give ourselves the permission to explore lots of different possibilities so that the right answer can reveal itself. (Patrice Martin, Co-lead and Creative director, IDEO)

Optimism
: Optimism is the thing that drives you forward. (John Bielenberg, Founder, Future Partners)

Iteration
: By iterating, we validate our ideas along the way because we're hearing from the people we're actually designing for. (Gaby Brink, Founder, Tomorrow Partners)
