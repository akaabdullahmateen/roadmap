## Statistics

Statistics is the mathematical science involving the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.

The word *statistics* comes from the German word *statistik*, which originally meant the *description of a state or country*.

### Applications

Statistical techniques are used in a wide range of scientific and social research to:

- Access risk in the insurance and finance industries.
- Study scientific phenomena and observations.
- Capture patterns in the data through the use of computation algorithms.
- Develop new insights and understanding of business performance and opportunities.
- Study factors affecting the health of population.
- Study human behavior in a social environment.
- Arrive at optimal or near optimal solutions to complex problems.

### Characteristics of Statistics

There are several important characteristic features of statistics:

- Statistics deals with the behavior of aggregates (large groups of data) rather than the individual objects of an aggregate.
- Statistics deals with aggregates of observations of the same kind rather than isolated figures.
- Statistics deals with variability that obscure underlying patterns.
- Statistics deals with uncertainties that result from deficiencies in the process of getting data.
- Statistics deals with characteristics that can be described numerically.
- Statistics deals with aggregates that are subject to randomness.
- Statistical laws are valid on the average and in the long run. There is no guarantee tha a certain law will hold in all cases.
- Statistical results might be misleading and incorrect if sufficient care in collecting, processing, and interpreting the data is not exercised.

### Descriptive and Inferential Statistics

Statistics as a subject may be divided into two broad branches:

Descriptive statistics
: The branch of statistics that deals with the concepts and methods related to the description and summarization of the important aspects of numerical data (such as tabular displays, central tendency, and spread of the observations).

Inferential statistics
: The branch of statistics that deals with the procedures for making inferences about the characteristics that describe the large group of data (population) from the knowledge derived from only a part of the data (sample) (such as estimation of population parameters and testing of statistical hypothesis).

| Descriptive statistics | Inferential statistics |
| - | - |
| A sports player wants to find his score average for the last 20 games. | A sports player wants to estimate his chance of scoring based on his current season average. |
| A student wants to describe the variation in his school examination marks. | A student wants to predict the variation in his official examination marks based on the school examination marks. |

### Populations and Samples

A *population* or a statistical population is the set (possibly infinite) of all possible observations relevant to some characteristic of interest. A statistical population may be real (such as the height of all students) or hypothetical (such as all the possible outcomes of a coin toss). The number of observations in a finite population is called the *size* of the population, and is denoted by the letter $N$. The numerical quantities describing a population are called *parameters*, and are conventionally denoted by Greek letters.

A *sample* is a subset of a population. Generally it consists of some observations, but in some cases, it may include the whole population. The number of observations in a sample is called the *size* of the sample, and is denoted by the letter $n$. A numerical quantity calculated from a sample is called a *statistic*, and is conventionally denoted by Latin letters. The information derived from sample data is used to draw conclusions about the population.

### Importance of Statistics

The following functions of statistics indicates its importance:

- Statistics assists in summarizing large sets of data in a form that is easily understandable.
- Statistics assists in designing scientific experiments efficiently.
- Statistics assists in planning surveys effectively.
- Statistics assists in drawing general conclusions and predictions.

The following uses of statistics indicates its importance:

- A businessman, industrialist, and research worker employ statistical methods in their work.
- An administrator, whether in public or private sector, uses statistical data to provide factual basis for a decision.
- A politician uses statistics to get support and credibility for his arguments.
- A social scientist uses statistical methods in various areas of society and economics. 

## Observations and Variables

In statistics, *observation* means any numerical quantity that describes an information or characteristic. It can be a physical measurement (such as height or weight), a classification (such as heads or tails), or an answer to a discrete question (such as yes or no).

### Variables

A *variable* is a characteristic that varies between individuals or objects (such as age is a variable that varies between persons). The given set of all possible values from which a variable takes its value is called a *domain*. If the domain of a variable contains only one value, then the variable is referred to as a *constant*.

```

Variables can be classified as either quantitative or qualitative depending on the characteristic being measured. A variable is called a *quantitative variable* when the characteristic can be expressed numerically (such as age or weight). A variable is called a *qualitative variable* when the characteristic is non-numerical in nature (such as eye color, gender, or satisfaction). A qualitative variable is also called an *attribute*. An individual or an object with a qualitative characteristic can be enumerated by assigning to them one of the several mutually exclusive classes or categories.

### Discrete and Continuous Variables

A quantitative variable can be classified as either discrete or continuous. A *discrete variable* is a variable that can only take values from a set of discrete integers. A discrete variable represents *count* data (such as the number of citizens, rooms, or accidents).

A *continuous variable* is a variable that can take any value from the set of real numbers within a given domain. A continuous variable represents *measurement* data (such as the age, height, or temperature).

A variable, whether countable or measurable, is generally denoted by some symbol (such as *X* or *Y*). The symbol *X<sub>i</sub>* represents the *ith* value of a variable; the subscript is replaced by a number when referring to a particular value.

### Measurement Scales

Measurement means assigning a number to an observation, and *scaling* is the process of measurement. Levels of measurement, also called scales of measurement, describes how precisely variables are recorded. The four levels of measurements are cumulative (they each take on the properties of lower levels and add new properties).

| Measurement scale | Description | Example |
| - | - | - |
| Nominal scale | Data is categorized by labelling them in mutually exclusive groups, but there is no order between the categories. | Gender (male or female: there is no particular order) |
| Ordinal scale | Data is categorized and ranked in an order, but there is no information about the intervals between the ranks. | Performance (good, average, or bad: there is no indication about how much an *average* is better than a *bad*) |
| Interval scale | Data is categorized, ranked, and evenly spaced (equal intervals can be inferred between neighboring data points), but there is no true zero point. | Test score (zero marks does not indicate an absolute lack of intelligence) |
| Ratio scale | Data is categorized, ranked, evenly spaced, and there is a true zero point (an absolute absence of the characteristic being measured) | Length (zero length means an absolute absence of length) |

| Data type | Mathematical operations | Measures of central tendency | Measures of variability |
| - | - | - | - |
| Nominal | Equality (=, $\not$=) | Mode | None |
| Ordinal | Equality (=, $\not$=), comparison (>, <) | Mode, median | Range, interquartile range |
| Interval | Equality (=, $\not$=), comparison (>, <), addition/subtraction (+, -) | Mode, median, arithmetic mean | Range, interquartile range, standard deviation, variance |
| Ratio | Equality (=, $\not$=), comparison (>, <), addition/subtraction (+, -), multiplication/division ($\times$, $\div$) | Mode, median, arithmetic mean, geometric mean | Range, interquartile range, standard deviation, variance, relative standard deviation |

### Errors of Measurement

A continuous variable can never be measured accurately because of errors in measurement. The deviations between the measured value ($x$) and the true value ($x + \epsilon$) are called *errors of measurement*.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{absolute error}   &= \text{true value} - \text{measured value} \\
                        &= \epsilon
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{relative error}   &= \frac{\text{absolute error}}{\text{true value}} \\
                        &= \frac{\epsilon}{x + \epsilon}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{percentage error} &= \text{relative error} \times 100\% \\
                        &= \frac{\epsilon}{x + \epsilon} \times 100\%
\end{aligned}
$$

*Absolute errors* have the same unit as that of the measured value ($x$). *Relative errors* and *percentage errors* are both unitless. These errors of measurement have both magnitude and direction. Note that the word *error* in statistics does not imply mistake in measurement, which is a chance inaccuracy.

An error is said to be *biased* when the deviations (excesses or defects) in the measured value from the true value are consistent and constant. Biased errors are not revealed by repeating the measurements, and are *cumulative* (increasing the number of observations increases the magnitude of the error). Biased errors are also called *cumulative errors* or *systematic errors*.

An error is said to be *unbiased* when the deviations (excesses or defects) in the measured value from the true value tend to occur equally often. Unbiased errors are revealed when measurements are repeated, and are *compensating* (they tend to cancel out in the long run). Unbiased errors are also called *random errors* or *accidental errors*.

### Significant Digits

*Significant digits* (also called *significant figures*) of a number are digits that are reliable and necessary to indicate the measurement. If a number expressing the result of a measurement has more digits than the number of digits allowed by the measurement resolution, then only as many digits as allowed by the measurement resolution are reliable, and so only these can be significant digits. Rules are identifying significant digits are given below:

- **Digits beyond the measurement resolution are *not* significant.**
  - 114.8 mm has four significant digits (1, 1, 4, and 8) if the resolution is 0.1 mm.
  - 114.8 mm has three significant digits (1, 1, and 4) if the resolution is 1 mm.
- **Non-zero digits within a measurement are significant.**
  - 123.45 mm has five significant digits (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) if the resolution is 0.01 mm.
  - 123.45 mm has four significant digits (1, 2, 3, and 4) if the resolution is 0.1 mm.
- **Zeroes between two significant non-zero digits are significant (significant trapped zeroes).**
  - 101.12003 mm has eight significant digits (1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, and 3) if the resolution is 0.00001 mm.
  - 101.12003 mm has seven significant digits (1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, and 0) if the resolution is 0.0001 mm.
- **Zeroes to the left of the first non-zero digit (leading zeroes) are *not* significant.**
  - 0.052 km has two significant digits (5 and 2) since it can be equivalently written as 52 m.
  - 0.00034 mm has two significant digits (3 and 4) if the resolution is 0.00001 mm.
- **Zeroes to the right of the last non-zero digit (trailing zeroes) in a number with the decimal point are significant.**
  - 1.200 mm has four significant digits (1, 2, 0, and 0) if the resolution is 0.001 mm.
  - 0.0980 mm has three significant digits (9, 8, and 0) if the resolution is 0.0001 mm.
- **Trailing zeroes in an integer may or may *not* be significant depending on the measurement resolution.**
  - 45,600 mm has five significant digits (4, 5, 6, 0, and 0) if the resolution is 1 mm.
  - 45,600 mm has three significant digits (4, 5, and 6) if the resolution is 100 mm.
- **An exact number has an infinite number of significant digits.**
  - If a box has 4 objects (exact number), it can equivalently be written as 4.0000... (infinite trailing zeroes, all of which are significant), therefore, the exact number 4 has an infinite number of significant digits.
- **A mathematical or physical constant has significant digits up to its known digits.**
  - If the mathematical constant $\pi$ (pi) is calculated as 3.141592653589793 (16 decimal digits), it has seventeen significant digits.
  - If the mathematical constant $\pi$ (pi) is calculated as 3.14 (2 decimal digits), it has three significant digits.

It should be remembered that:

- Significant digits in a number are not changed by the location of the decimal point; therefore, measurements recorded as 269, 26.9, 0.269, and 0.000269, all have three significant digits.
- Discrete data which are generated by the process of counting have infinite significant digits because the accuracy can not be improved, and they can be equivalently written with infinite trailing zeroes (to the right of decimal point), all of which are correct.
- The rules regarding the determination of the number of significant digits are applicable to continuous variables.
- In the operations of addition and subtraction, all digit positions which are not significant in any of the values being added or subtracted, are not significant in the total or difference.
- In the operations of multiplication and division, the number of significant digits in the result is determined by the value with the smallest number of significant digits used in the calculation.

### Rounding Off a Number

*Rounding off* (or simply *rounding*) means replacing a number with an approximate value that has a shorter, simpler, and more explicit representation. For integers, the last few digits are replaced with zeroes. For decimal numbers, the last few digits are dropped. For a given precision, the following rules are used for rounding:

- If the digit following the last significant digit is greater than 5 or equal to 5 and followed by digits (not all of which are zero), the last significant digit is increased by 1, and the digits following it are dropped or replaced with zeroes.
  - 2.145001 is 2.15 when rounded to 3 significant digits.
  - 2145001 is 2150000 when rounded to 3 significant digits.
- If the digit following the last significant digit is less than 5, the last significant digit remains unchanged, and the digits following it are dropped or replaced with zeroes.
  - 2.1548 is 2.15 when rounded to 3 significant digits.
  - 21548 is 21500 when rounded to 3 significant digits.
- If the digit following the last significant digit is exactly 5, conventionally, the last significant digit is increased by 1, if it is odd, and remains unchanged, if it is even. This ensures that round-off errors are symmetric (for every fraction rounded down, there is an equal chance of a fraction being rounded up).
  - 4.535 is 4.54 when rounded to 3 significant digits.
  - 2.745 is 2.74 when rounded to 3 significant digits.

However, to prevent accumulating round-off errors, the process of rounding the numbers should be applied to the final result, rather than intermediate calculations.

## Collection of Data

Statistical data is collected either by a *complete* enumeration of the whole field, called *census*, which in many cases would be too costly and time consuming, as it requires a large number of enumerators and supervisory staff, or by a *partial* enumeration associated with a sample, which saves time and money.

When data are classified based on *source*, generally, the following distinctions are made:

Primary data
: Data that have been originally collected (*raw data*) and have not undergone any sort of treatment by statistical methods.

Secondary data
: Data that have undergone any sort of treatment by statistical methods at least once (such as data being collected, classified, tabulated, or presented in some form for a certain purpose).

The survey research includes the following important steps:

- To define the objectives of the survey.
- To define the variable and the population of interest.
- To define the data collection and data measuring schemes.
- To determine the appropriate descriptive and inferential data analysis techniques.

### Collection of Primary Data

The primary data is obtained from the following sources:

Direct personal investigation
: In this method, an investigator collects the information personally from the individual concerned. Since he interviews the informants himself, the information collected is generally considered quite accurate and complete. However, this method is very costly and time consuming when the area to be covered is large. Nevertheless, it is useful for laboratory experiments or localized inquiries. Errors are likely to enter the results due to personal bias of the investigator.

Indirect investigation
: Sometimes the direct sources do not exist or the informants hesitate to respond. In such cases, third parties or witnesses, who have the necessary information, are interviewed. As some of the informants are likely to deliberately give wrong information, consensus from multiple witnesses is required. Moreover, due allowance is to be made for personal bias. This method is useful when the information desired is complex or there is reluctance or indifference in the informants. It can be adopted for extensive inquiries.

Collection through questionnaire
: A questionnaire is an inquiry form containing relevant questions with space for entering the information asked. The questionnaire are usually sent by mail and the informants are requested to return the questionnaire to the investigator within a certain period of time. This method is cheap, efficient, and good for extensive inquiries. However, most of the respondents do not care to fill the questionnaires and return them to the investigators. Sometimes, the questionnaires are returned incomplete and full of errors. Regardless of these drawbacks, this method is the standard practice for routine business and administrative inquiries. It should be noted that the questions should be few, brief, simple, easy for all respondents to answer, clearly worded, and not offensive to certain respondents.

Collection through enumerators
: In this method, the information is gathered by employing trained enumerators who assist the informants in making the entries in the schedules or questionnaires correctly. This method gives the most reliable information if the enumerator is well trained. It is considered the best method when a large scale government inquiry is to be conducted. This method can not be adopted by private companies or individuals due to the cost required.

Collection through local sources
: In this method, there is no formal collection of data. Instead, agents or local correspondents are directed to  collect and send the required information, using their own judgement. This method is cheap and efficient, but gives only the estimates.

Computer interviews
: In this method, the respondents enter data directly into a computer in response to questions presented on the screen.

Laboratory experiments
: In this method, independent variables are manipulated in an artificial environment, to observe the impacts. Basic design considers the impact of only one independent variable.

Field experiments
: In this method, independent variables are manipulated in a natural environment, to observe the impacts.

### Collection of Secondary Data

The secondary data is obtained from the following sources:

Internal secondary data
: Data is generated within an organization itself (such as sales invoices and accounting records).

External secondary data
: This includes official sources (such as official publications by standard institutions), semi-official sources (such as reports by banks and councils), and other credible sources (such as reputable journals and publications by research institutions).

### Editing of Data

The primary data should be extensively checked at an early stage in order to identify incomplete or inconsistent entries. If possible, incomplete and defective questionnaires should be returned to the respondents for amendments. In order to accept the secondary data as authoritative, the reliability of the compiler, suitability of the data, scope of the inquiry, sources of information, and the degree of accuracy should be critically examined.

### Uses and Misuses of Statistics

A few examples of uses of statistics are given below:

- In experimental sciences, the experiments generate data, and this data must be collected and analyzed.
- In government, many types of statistical data are collected all the time. This data can be used for various types of planning, and to inform the general public.
- In education, statistics is used to describe the results and standards of education.

Statistical techniques are often misused as well:

- To sell products that do not work.
- To prove something that is not really true.
- To get the attention of public by evoking fear and shock.

Statistics is misused by many ways:

- Non-representative samples.
- Small sample size
- Ambiguous averages and dispersions
- Detached facts
- Implied connections
- Incorrect and misleading graphs
- Incorrect use of statistical techniques
- Bad assumptions for statistical techniques
