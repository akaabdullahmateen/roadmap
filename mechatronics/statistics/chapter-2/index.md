## Introduction

The collection of data often results in massive volume of statistical data. This data is unorganized; hence, it is difficult to examine. The huge data is therefore organized and presented in a form that is more easily understood and interpreted.

## Classification

*Classification* is the process of sorting a set of observations into homogenous classes or groups such that the following rules are satisfied:

- Observations in the same class are similar.
- Observations in each class are dissimilar to observations in other classes.

This classification can be done according to one or more criteria:

One-way classification or simple classification
: The data is sorted according to one criterion.

Two-way classification
: The data is sorted according to two criteria.

Manifold classification or cross classification
: The data is sorted according to more than two criteria.

Arrangement of data according to the values of a *variable* characteristic is called a *distribution*. The criteria for a distribution can be *qualitative*, *temporal*, or *geographical* characteristics.

Spatial or geographical distribution
: The data is sorted according to location.

Time series or temporal distribution
: The data is sorted according to time.

### Aims of classification

The main aims of classification are:

- To summarize the large sets of data in a more readable form.
- To display the points of similarity and dissimilarity.
- To eliminate unnecessary details.
- To present the important aspects of data.
- To prepare the data for comparison and inference.

### Basic principles of classifications

Classification of large sets of data should be based on the following principles:

- The classes should be *mutually exclusive*; no overlap should exist between successive classes.
- The classes should be *all inclusive*; every observation must fit in to any one of the classes.
- The classification procedure should not be so elaborate that it leads to trivial classes, nor should it be so crude that it concentrates all the data in only one or two classes.
- The conventional classification procedure should be adopted, as far as possible.

## Tabulation

*Tabulation* is a systematic presentation of data where data is classified under suitable heads and subheads, and placed in columns and rows.

The logical arrangement, from tabulation, makes the data easy to understand, facilitates comparisons, and makes it readable.

### Types of tables

Statistical tables, classified according to purpose, are of the following types:

General purpose or primary tables
: These tables are created for general purposes, to be used as a reference. Therefore, they are large, extensive, and exhaustive. 

Specific purpose or derived tables
: These tables are created for specific purposes, to be used for analyzing specific patterns in the data. Therefore, they are simpler, and data is classified based on only a few criteria.

Statistical tables, classified according to criteria, are of the following types:

Single tabulation
: Data is classified according to one criterion.

Double tabulation
: Data is classified according to two criteria.

Manifold tabulation
: Data is classified according to more than two criteria.

### Main parts of a table

The main parts of a statistical table are:

Title
: A self-explanatory text at the top of the table, that indicates what the table describes or what data is presented.

Column captions
: The heading of each column, that indicates the characteristic that is common to the data in that column.

Boxhead
: The row of the table that contains the column captions.

Row captions
: The heading of each row, that indicates the characteristic that is common to the data in that row.

Stub
: The column of the table that contains the row captions.

Prefatory notes
: Explanatory notes placed beneath the title of the table, that usually describe the units of measurements, or indicate items included or excluded from the data.

Footnotes
: Explanatory notes placed beneath the body of the table, that provide additional descriptions or explain certain choices affecting the data.

Source notes
: References to the source of the data presented in the table, that include details about the publication of the source.

Body
: The main part of the table that contains the data arranged in columns and rows.

Rulings
: The lines that form the skeleton of the table.

### Construction of a table

The general rules to be observed in constructing a table are given below:

Title
: - Titles should be brief; usually a small phrase instead of complete sentences.
  - Abbreviations should not be used.
  - Main titles should be in capital case throughout. Subtitles, if any, should be in title case.
  - Different parts of a title should be separated by comma, but no period should be placed at the end.
  - Words in a title should not be hyphenated, unless necessary.
  - For long titles that must span more than one line, an *inverted pyramid* arrangement of the lines should be used.

Column captions and boxhead
: - Column captions or headings should be clear and concise.
  - The leftmost column should be used for the most important or primary characteristic.
  - The rightmost column should be used for the totals, if any.
  - Column captions should be in sentence case, but no period should be placed at the end.
  - Abbreviations can be used, if appropriate.
  - Main captions should be horizontally centered inside their column heads.
  - If a column caption is long, it should be split over multiple lines in an *inverted pyramid* arrangement.
  - If possible, column captions should be chosen so that their width is roughly similar to the width of the numbers inserted in their columns.

Row captions and stub
: - The rules for column captions also apply to row captions.
  - If the stub is long and has several levels of classification, the major classifications should be capitalized, to separate the table into parts.
  - Whenever the numerical figures have more than four significant digits, a space or comma is placed after every three digits, starting from the radix point.
  - In long tables, some space should be left after every five or ten rows.
  - The bottommost row should be used for the totals, if any.
  - Every stub should have an appropriate heading describing its content. This heading should be centered in the upper left box of the table.

Prefatory notes
: - Prefatory notes should be placed between the title and boxhead of the table.
  - Prefatory notes should be in sentence case.
  - Prefatory notes should be enclosed in brackets.

Footnotes
: - Footnotes should be placed immediately beneath the table, but above the source notes.
  - References to footnotes should be done by footnote symbols ($\ast$, $\dagger$, $\ddagger$, $\P$).
  - If a footnote symbol refer to an entire column, it should be placed beside the column caption.
  - If a footnote symbol refer to an entire row, it should be placed beside the row caption.
  - If a footnote symbol refer to a single cell, it should be placed beside the cell entry.

Source notes
: - Source notes should be placed below the footnotes.
  - Every table must have a source note, unless the table is an original tabulation and its source is clear from the context.
  - Source notes should include the compiling agency name, publication date, and other information necessary for verification or reference.

Body
: - The number of columns and rows required can be guessed by drawing a rough sketch.
  - The arrangement of data should be according to the criteria of classification or purpose of the table. Therefore, the data can be arranged according to the alphabetical order, time of occurrence, location, magnitude, importance, or any other customary classification.

Spacing and rulings
: - The spacing between the different parts of the table, and between the cells, should be large enough for the legitimacy of the text and numbers, but small enough to allow for easy comprehension.
  - Thick or double lines should be used as rulings for emphasis of certain cells.
  - Thick or double lines should be used as rulings for showing the relationship between the main parts of the table to the whole.
  - Thin or single lines should be used as rulings under the column captions.

General
: - A table should be simple; a complex table should be broken down into relatively simple tables, if possible.
  - Units of measurements and nature of the data should be specified in the title and captions, and enclosed in parenthesis.
  - Percentages should be clearly indicated, and their total should be shown as $100\%$.
  - If the numerical figures in the table are rounded off, this should be indicated in the prefatory notes or captions.
  - The items that need to be emphasized should be placed in a prominent position of the table.

## Frequency distributions

*Frequency distribution* is the distribution of observations into classes together with the number of observations in each class. The number of observations in a particular class is called the *class frequency* (or simply *frequency*), and denoted as $f$.

Data presented in a frequency distribution is called *grouped data*; whereas, data in its original form is called *ungrouped data*.

Data arranged in ascending or descending order of magnitude is referred to as being arranged in an *array*.

Frequency distributions allow for observing patterns in the distribution. A common frequency pattern is the rising to a peak and the declining.

### Class limits

In a frequency distribution, the *class limits* describe the smallest and largest values that can belong to a class. The *upper class limit* describes the largest value that can belong to the class; while, the *lower class limit* describes the smallest value that can belong to the class.

Class limits are *inclusive* and have no overlapping, therefore, the value corresponding exactly to the lower class limit or the upper class limit is included in the class. The class limits should therefore have the same number of significant digits as the recorded values.

A class that has either no upper class limit or lower class limit, is called an *open ended class*. Open ended classes should be avoided since they hinder certain conveniences in calculations.

!!! note

    A class indicated as $10 - 15$ describes the range $10 \leq X < 15$; therefore, the exact value $10$ is included but the exact value $15$ is not included in the class.

### Class boundaries

*Class boundaries* are the precise numbers which separate adjacent classes. A class boundary is located midway between the upper class limit of a class and the lower class limit of the higher class. The upper class boundary of a class coincides with the lower class boundary of the higher class.

$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{Lower class boundary}
\text{lower class boundary} = \text{class midpoint} - \frac{\text{class interval}}{2}
\end{equation}
$$

$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{Upper class boundary}
\text{upper class boundary} = \text{class midpoint} + \frac{\text{class interval}}{2}
\end{equation}
$$

The class boundaries are thus always defined more precisely than the level of measurement used. This avoids the possibility of any value lying exactly on the class boundary.

!!! example

    **Determine class boundaries for the following class limits.**

    | Class limits | Class boundaries | Inclusion            |
    | ------------ | ---------------- | -------------------- |
    | $10 - 14$    | $9.5 - 14.5$     | $9.5 \leq X < 14.5$  |
    | $15 - 19$    | $14.5 - 19.5$    | $14.5 \leq X < 19.5$ |
    | $20 - 24$    | $19.5 - 24.5$    | $19.5 \leq X < 24.5$ |
    | $25 - 29$    | $24.5 - 29.5$    | $24.5 \leq X < 29.5$ |

### Class mark

*Class mark* (also called class midpoint) is the average of the upper class boundary and lower class boundary of a class.

$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{Class mark}
\text{class mark} = \frac{\text{upper class limit} + \text{lower class limit}}{2}
\end{equation}
$$

For purposes of calculation, where a single value is required for each class, the frequency of a particular class is assumed to have the same value as the class mark. This assumption, however, introduces an error, called *grouping error*, but such errors are small and are counterbalanced over the entire distribution.

The grouping error can also be minimized by choosing classes in such a way that the midpoints correspond to the means of the observations in those class.

### Class interval or width

*Class interval* (also called class width) is the difference between the class boundaries. It is equivalent to the difference between two successive lower class limits, and the difference between two successive upper class limits.

$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{Class interval}
\text{class interval} = \text{upper class boundary} - \text{lower class boundary}
\end{equation}
$$

### Constructing a frequency distribution

The following rules should be considered when constructing a grouped frequency distribution:

Decide the number of classes
: Although there are no strict guidelines for the choice of the number of classes, no less than 5 and no greater than 20 classes are generally used.

    Too few classes defeat the purpose of condensation; while, too many classes will result in too much loss of information.

    H. A. Sturges has proposed an empirical rule for determining the number of classes into which the set of observations should be grouped; where $k$ denotes the number of classes and $N$ is the total number of observations:

    $$
    \begin{equation}
    \tag{H. A. Sturges rule}
    k = 1 + 3.3 \log{N}
    \end{equation}
    $$

Determine the range of variation in the data
: This is the difference between the largest and the smallest value in the data.

    $$
    \begin{equation}
    \tag{Range}
    \text{range} = \text{largest value} - \text{smallest value}
    \end{equation}
    $$

Divide the range of variation by the number of classes
: This determines the approximate class intervals. In case of fractional results, the next higher whole number is used. But in practice, class intervals are multiples of 5 or 10, since they are easy to comprehend.

Decide the class limits
: The lowest class usually starts with the smallest data value; if the smallest data value is not convenient, a number smaller than that is used instead. The lower class boundary of the lowest class limit should be determined appropriately. The upper class limit of the lowest class is calculated by adding the class interval to the lower class boundary.

Determine the remaining class limits
: The class limits and class boundaries of subsequent classes are calculated by repeatedly adding the class interval to the upper class boundaries of the earlier classes. The lowest class is placed at the top of the distribution when presenting the data.

Calculate the frequency of each class
: The data is distributed into the appropriate classes based on the class boundaries. For each class, the total number of observations that lie in that class, is calculated. This number is the frequency of the class, and is written in the frequency column.

Calculate the total of the frequency column
: All the frequencies in the frequency column are added to get the total of the frequency column. This should equal the total number of observations.

!!! note

    These rules are applied to group raw data which are assumed to be continuous. In case of discrete data, the concept of class boundaries is unrealistic, as there can be no points where the adjoining classes meet. Despite this, when the discrete data is sufficiently large, it is treated as continuous, and hence, is grouped in the same way as continuous data.


!!! example

    **Make a grouped frequency distribution for the following data.**
    
    ```
    93      95      76      82      70      84
    106     105     119     119     117     104
    ```

    <!-- Some values are emphasized to show that classes are inclusive -->

    | Classes   | Class boundaries | Class marks | Entries  (optional)         | Frequencies |
    | --------- | ---------------- | ----------- | --------------------------- | ----------- |
    | 65 - 84   | 64.5 - 84.5      | 74.5        | 76, 82, 70, **84**          | 4           |
    | 85 - 104  | 84.5 - 104.5     | 94.5        | 93, 95, **104**             | 3           |
    | 105 - 124 | 104.5 - 124.5    | 114.5       | 106, **105**, 119, 119, 117 | 5           |
    | Total     |                  |             |                             | 12          |

### Cumulative frequency distribution

**Cumulative frequency** is the total of frequencies from one end (called *base*) to a certain value. A table that shows the cumulative frequencies is called a *cumulative frequency distribution*.

The cumulative frequency of the last class is the total frequency of the observations in the distribution.

The cumulative frequency distribution is classified into the following types:

Less than cumulative frequency
: A cumulative frequency distribution where the cumulation process is from the lowest value to the highest value. The less than frequency distribution starts with the lower class boundary of the lowest class, indicating that there is no frequency until it.

More than cumulative frequency
: A cumulative frequency distribution where the cumulation process is from the highest value to the lowest value. The more than frequency distribution starts with the upper class boundary of the highest class, indicating that there is no frequency beyond it.

!!! example

    **Create a less than cumulative frequency distribution and more than cumulative frequency distribution for a frequency distribution with $k$ classes, each with the class interval $h$, the midpoint of the $i^{th}$ class is represented by $x_i$ with frequency $f_i$ such that $\sum^k_{i=1}f_i = n$.**

    **Less than cumulative frequency distribution**

    | Class boundary                | Cumulative frequency |
    | ----------------------------- | -------------------- |
    | less than $x_1 - \frac{h}{2}$ | $0$                  |
    | less than $x_1 + \frac{h}{2}$ | $f_1$                |
    | less than $x_2 + \frac{h}{2}$ | $f_1 + f_2$          |
    | less than $x_3 + \frac{h}{2}$ | $f_1 + f_2 + f_3$    |
    | less than $x_k + \frac{h}{2}$ | $\sum f_i = n$       |


    **More than cumulative frequency distribution**

    | Class boundary                | Cumulative frequency |
    | ----------------------------- | -------------------- |
    | more than $x_1 - \frac{h}{2}$ | $\sum f_i = n$       |
    | more than $x_1 + \frac{h}{2}$ | $f_1 + f_2 + f_3$    |
    | more than $x_2 + \frac{h}{2}$ | $f_1 + f_2$          |
    | more than $x_3 + \frac{h}{2}$ | $f_1$                |
    | more than $x_k + \frac{h}{2}$ | $0$                  |

*Relative frequency* is the frequency of a class divided by the total frequency. Relative frequencies can be expressed as percentages. A *percentage cumulative distribution* is used to show the percentage of values falling between certain specified values.
