# Embedded systems

## Introduction, examples of embedded systems

An embedded system is a system that performs a specific task and has a computer embedded or hidden inside. A system is comprised of components and interfaces connected together for a common purpose.

An embedded system is the combination of electrical, chemical, mechanical, optical, computer, software, all combined for a dedicated purpose.

## Binary to decimal conversion

Because the memory on most computers is 8 bits wide, most of the binary numbers stored in the computer will have 8, 16, or 32 bits. A 4-bit number is called a nibble, 8-bit number is called a byte, a 16-bit number is called a halfword, and a 32-bit number is called a word.

Each hexadecimal digit is equivalent to a nibble. So to convert a hexadecimal number to its binary equivalent, simply join the binary nibble of each digit.
