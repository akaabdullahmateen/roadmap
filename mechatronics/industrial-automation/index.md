# Industrial automation

## Lecture 1

### Automation

Automation is the process of following a predetermined sequence of operations to perform a task with little or no human intervention.

### Production system

A production system is a collection of people, equipment, and procedures organized to perform the manufacturing operations of a company. It consists of two major components:

Facilities
: The physical facilities of the production system include the equipment, the way the equipment is laid out, and the factory in which the equipment is located. Manufacturing systems and factory plant layout are included in the facilities.

Manufacturing support systems
: These are the procedures used by the company to manage production and to solve the technical and logistics problems encountered in ordering materials, moving the work through the factory, and ensuring the products meet quality standards. Product design, manufacturing planning, manufacturing control, and other business functions are included in the manufacturing support systems.

### Categories of manufacturing systems

#### Manual work system

A manual work system consists of one or more workers. Manual material handling tasks are common activities in manual work systems. Production tasks commonly require the use of hand tools, such as screw drivers and hammers. When using hand tools, a work holder is often employed to grasp the work part and position it securely for processing.

Examples of production-related manual tasks involving the use of hand tools include:

- A machinist using a file to round the edges of a rectangular part that has just been milled.
- A quality control inspector using a micrometer to measure the diameter of a shaft.
- A material handling worker using a dolly to move cartons in a warehouse.
- A team of assembly workers putting together a piece of machinery using hand tools.

#### Worker-machine system

In a worker-machine system, a human worker operates powered equipment, such as a machine tool or other production machine. This is one of the most widely used manufacturing systems. Worker-machine systems include combinations of one or more workers and one or more pieces of equipment. The workers and machines are combined to take advantage of their relative strengths and attributes.

Examples of worker-machine systems include the following:

- A machinist operating an engine lathe to fabricate a part for a product.
- A fitter and an industrial robot working together in an arc-welding work cell.
- A crew of workers operating a rolling mill that converts hot steel slabs into flat plates.
- A production line in which the products are moved by mechanized conveyor and the workers at some of the stations use power tools to accomplish their processing or assembly tasks.

#### Automated manufacturing system

Automated manufacturing systems operate in the factory on the physical product. They perform operations such as processing, assembly, inspection, and material handling, in many cases accomplishing more than one of these operations in the same system. They are called automated because they perform their operations with a reduced level of human participation compared with the corresponding manual process. In some highly automated systems, there is virtually no human participation.

Examples of automated manufacturing systems include:

- Automated machine tools that process parts.
- Transfer lines that perform a series of machining operations.
- Automated assembly systems.
- Manufacturing systems that use industrial robots to perform processing or assembly operations.
- Automatic material handling and storage systems to integrate manufacturing operations.
- Automatic inspection systems for quality control.

### Advantages of automation

- Less dependence on human labor: Automation can overcome a shortage of labor or high cost of labor.
- Increased productivity: Higher production output per hour of labor input is possible with automation than with manual operations. Productivity is the single most important factor in determining a nation's standard of living. If the value of output per hour goes up, the overall income levels go up.
- Competition: The ultimate goal of a company is to increase profits. However, there are other goals that are harder to measure. Automation may result in lower prices, superior products, better labor relations, and a better company image.
- Safety: Automation allows the employee to assume a supervisory role instead of being directly involved in the manufacturing task. For example, die casting is hot and dangerous and the work pieces are often very heavy. Welding, spray painting, and other operations can be a health hazard. Machines can do these jobs more precisely and achieve better quality products.
- Reducing manufacturing lead-time: Automation allows the manufacturer to respond quickly to the consumers needs. Second, flexible automation allows companies to handle frequent design modifications.
- Lower costs: In addition to cutting labor costs, automation may decrease the scrap rate and thus reduce the cost of raw materials. It also enables just-in-time manufacturing which in turn allows the manufacturer to reduce the in-process inventory. It is possible to improve the quality of the product at lower cost.

### Types of automation

- Fixed automation: It is used when a very high production quantity (usually a million parts) but a very small product variety is required.
- Flexible automation: It is used when a moderate production quantity (usually a few thousand parts) and moderate product variety is required.
- Programmable automation: It is used when a small production quantity (usually a few hundred parts) but very high product variety is required.

### Manual labor in production systems

Manual labor in factory operations
: Certainly, one of the current economic realities in the world is that there are countries whose average hourly wage rates are so low that most automation projects are difficult to justify strictly on the basis of cost reduction.

- Labor in manufacturing support systems.

### Comparison between humans and machines

| Humans | Machines |
| - | - |
| Sense unexpected stimuli | Perform repetitive tasks consistently |
| Develop new solutions to problems | Store large amounts of data |
| Cope with abstract problems | Retrieve data from memory reliably |
| Adapt to change | Perform multiple tasks simultaneously |
| Generalize from observations | Apply high forces and power |
| Learn from experience | Perform simple computations quickly |
| Make decisions based on incomplete data | Make routine decisions quickly |

### Sitautions where manual labor is preferred

- Task is technologically too difficult to automate. Examples include:
  - Automobile final assembly lines where many final trim operations are accomplished by human workers.
  - Inspection tasks that require judgement to access quality.
  - Material handling tasks that involve flexible or fragile materials.
- Short product life cycle.
- Customized product.
- Changes in demand.
- Need to reduce risk of product failure.
- Lack of capital.

### USA Principle

The USA Principle involves first understanding the existing process, then finding opportunities to simplify the process, and finally automating the process.

#### Understand the existing process

- What are the inputs?
- What are the outputs?
- What happens to the work units between input and output?
- What is the function of the process?
- How does it add value to the product?

#### Simply the process

- What is the purpose of this step or this transport?
- Is the step necessary?
- Can it be eliminated?
- How can it be simplified?
- Can steps be combined?
- Can steps be performed simultenously?
- Can steps be integrated into a manually operated production line?

### Ten strategies for automation and process improvement

- Specialization of operations
- Combined operations
- Simultaneous operations
- Integration of operations
- Increased flexibility
- Improved material handling and storage
- On-line inspection
- Process control and optimization
- Plant operations control
- Computer-Integrated Manufacturing (CIM)

### Automation migration strategy

Phase 1
: Manual production - quick and low cost tooling.

Phase 2
: Automated production - single automated cells with manual handling of the product between workstations.

Phase 3
: Automated integrated production - multistation automated system with automated material handling betwen the stations.

### PLC

A PLC is a special form of a microprocessor-based controller. It uses programmable memory to store instructions and to implement functions such as logic, sequencing, and arithmetic to control machines and processes. Moreover, PLCs are designed to be operated by engineers with perhaps a limited knowledge of computers and programming languages.
