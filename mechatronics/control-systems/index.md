## Introduction

### Static and dynamic systems

## Linear systems

### Superposition principle

A system satisfies the superposition principle if the net response caused by two or more stimuli is the sum of the responses that would have been caused by each stimuli individually. Superposition can be defined by two simpler properties:

$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{Additivity}
F(x_1 + x_2) = F(x_1) + F(x_2)
\end{equation}
$$

$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{Homogeneity}
F(\alpha x) = \alpha F(x)
\end{equation}
$$

### Linearity

A system is considered linear if it satisfies the superposition principle. In a linear system, if input $u_1$ produces response $y_1$ and input $u_2$ produces response $y_2$, then the weighted sum of these inputs must produce the weighted sum of these responses.

$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{Linearity}
\alpha_1 y_1(t) + \alpha_2 y_2(t) = F(\alpha_1 u_1(t) + \alpha_2 u_2(t))
\end{equation}
$$

Generally, any system described by a differential equation of the following form is linear, with $n \geq m$.

$$
a_n \frac {d^n}{dt^n} y(t) + a_{n - 1} \frac {d^{n - 1}}{dt^{n - 1}} y(t) + \dots + a_0 y(t) = b_m \frac {d^m}{dt^m} x(t) + b_{m - 1} \frac {d^{m - 1}}{dt^{m - 1}} x(t) + \dots + b_0 x(t)
$$

### Time invariance

A system is considered time-invariant if a time delay on the input function $u(t - \tau)$ directly equates to a time delay on the output function $y(t - \tau)$. In other words, if the input to the system is applied $\tau$ time units later, the output will be identical except for the equivalent time delay.

$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{Time invariance}
y(t - \tau) = F(u(t - \tau))
\end{equation}
$$

### Convolution

The convolution $f \ast g$ is defined as the integral of the product of the two functions after one is reflected about the y-axis and shifted.

$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{Convolution}
\begin{aligned}
(f \ast g)(t) &= \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} f(t - \tau) g(\tau) d\tau \\
              &= \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} f(\tau) g(t - \tau) d\tau
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$

### Impulse response

The impulse response $h(t)$ of a system is its output when presented with a brief input signal called a *unit impulse*. A unit impulse $\delta(t)$ is a function whose value is zero everywhere except at zero, and whose integral over the entire real line is equal to one.

$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{Impulse response}
h(t) = F(\delta(t))
\end{equation}
$$

The convolution of the unit impulse function with another function $f(t)$ is simply $f(t)$.

$$
(\delta \ast f)(t) = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} f(\tau) \delta(t - \tau) d\tau = f(t)
$$

### Linear time invariant systems

Linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems are systems that are both linear and time-invariant. LTI systems are of special interest because they can be characterized entirely by a single function called the *impulse response*. Once the impulse response is known for an LTI system, responses to all inputs can be found.

The output function $y(t)$ is the convolution of the input function $x(t)$ with the impulse response $h(t)$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
y(t) &= \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} u(\tau) h(t - \tau) d\tau \\
     &= h(t) \ast u(t)
\end{aligned}
$$

### Causal systems

A causal system is a system where the output depends on past and current inputs but not future inputs. The integral for the output function $y(t)$ of an LTI system can hence be modified so that the upper limit is $t$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
y(t) &= \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} u(\tau) h(t - \tau) d\tau \\
     &= \int^{t}_{-\infty} u(\tau) h(t - \tau) d\tau
\end{aligned}
$$

All physical systems respond to input only after the input is applied. In mathematical notation, this means that $u(t) = 0$ and $h(t) = 0$ for all $t < 0$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
y(t) &= \int^{t}_{-\infty} u(\tau) h(t - \tau) d\tau \\
     &= \int^{t}_{0} u(\tau) h(t - \tau) d\tau
\end{aligned}
$$

### Complex numbers

A complex number is a number of the form $z = x + \iota y$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, and $i$ is an indeterminate called the *imaginary unit* and satisfies $\iota ^2 = -1$.

The *argument* $\theta$ of a complex number $z$ is the polar angle from the positive real axis to the vector representing $z$ in the complex plane. For $x > 0$:

$$
\theta = \arg (x + \iota y) = \arctan{\frac{y}{x}}
$$

The *modulus* $r$ of a complex number $z$ is the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point representing $z$ in the complex plane.

$$
r = |x + \iota y| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$

Euler's formula establishes the fundamental relationship between the complex exponential function and trigonometric functions. Euler's formula states that for any real number $\theta$:

$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{Euler's formula}
\cos{\theta} + \iota \sin{\theta} = e^{\iota \theta}
\end{equation}
$$

Euler's formula allows to alternate between *rectangular form* ($z = x + \iota y$) and *polar form* ($z = |z| \angle \arg (z)$).

$$
r (\cos{\theta} + \iota \sin{\theta}) = r e^{\iota \theta}
$$

Arithmetic rules for two complex numbers $z_1$ and $z_2$ are given below. Note that addition and subtraction are more naturally expressed in rectangular form, and multiplication and division are more cleanly expressed in polar form.

$$
\begin{aligned}
z_1 + z_2 &= (x_1 + x_2) + i (y_1 + y_2) \\
z_1 - z_2 &= (x_1 - x_2) + i (y_1 - y_2) \\
z_1 \times z_2 &= |z_1| |z_2| \angle \arg (z_1) + \arg (z_2) \\
z_1 \div z_2 &= \frac{|z_1|}{|z_2|} \angle \arg (z_1) - \arg (z_2)
\end{aligned}
$$

### Frequency domain

The frequency domain refers to the analysis of functions or signals with respect to frequency rather than time. A time domain graph shows how a signal changes over time, whereas a frequency domain graph shows how much of the signal lies within each given frequency band over a range of frequencies.

For systems described by linear differential equations, converting the system from time domain to frequency domain converts the differential equations to algebraic equations, which are much easier to solve.

### Laplace transform

The Laplace transform is an integral transform that converts a function of a real variable in the time domain to a function of a complex variable in the frequency domain. It transforms ordinary differential equations into algebraic equations and convolution into multiplication.

The Laplace transform of a function $y(t)$ is defined for all real numbers $t \geq 0$ as $Y(s)$, where $s = \sigma + \iota \omega$.

$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{Laplace transform}
Y(s) = \mathcal{L} \lbrace y(t) \rbrace = \int^{\infty}_{0} y(t) e^{-st} dt
\end{equation}
$$

### Convolution theorem

The convolution theorem states that the Laplace transform of the convolution of two functions is the pointwise product of their Laplace transforms. For an LTI system with impulse response $h(t)$, input signal $x(t)$, and output response $y(t)$, the convolution theorem implies:

$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{Convolution theorem}
y(t) = h(t) \ast x(t) \iff Y(s) = H(s) X(s)
\end{equation}
$$

### Transfer function

The transfer function $H(s)$ of an LTI system is a mathematical function that theoretically models the system's output for each possible input. Thus, the transfer function $H(s)$ is the linear mapping of the Laplace transform of the input, $X(s) = \mathcal{L} \lbrace x(t) \rbrace$, to the Laplace transform of the output, $Y(s) = \mathcal{L} \lbrace y(t) \rbrace$:

$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{Transfer function}
H(s) = \frac{Y(s)}{X(s)}
\end{equation}
$$

For an LTI system described as an ordinary differential equation, with input signal $x(t)$ and output response $y(t)$, the impulse response $h(t)$ can be written symbolically using the *differential operator $D$* ($D^n = \frac{d^n}{dt^n}$).

$$
\begin{aligned}
a_n \frac {d^n}{dt^n} y(t) + a_{n - 1} \frac {d^{n - 1}}{dt^{n - 1}} y(t) + \dots + a_0 y(t) &= b_m \frac {d^m}{dt^m} x(t) + b_{m - 1} \frac {d^{m - 1}}{dt^{m - 1}} x(t) + \dots + b_0 x(t) \\[10pt]
h(t) = \frac{y(t)}{x(t)} &= \frac{b_m D^m + b_{m - 1} D^{m - 1} + \dots + b_0}{a_n D^n + a_{n - 1} D^{n - 1} + \dots + a_0}
\end{aligned}
$$

The transfer function $H(s)$ is obtained by applying Laplace transform $\mathcal{L}\lbrace\frac{d^n}{dt^n}f(t)\rbrace = s^n F(s)$ to the differential equations describing the system, assuming zero initial conditions.

$$
\begin{aligned}
a_n s^n Y(s) + a_{n - 1} s^{n - 1} Y(s) + \dots + a_0 Y(s) &= b_m s^m X(s) + b_{m - 1} s^{m - 1} X(s) + \dots + b_0 X(s) \\[10pt]
H(s) = \frac{Y(s)}{X(x)} &= \frac{b_m s^m + b_{m - 1} s^{m - 1} + \dots + b_0}{a_n s^n + a_{n - 1} s^{n - 1} + \dots + a_0}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Typical inputs

Dynamic systems respond to initial conditions and input signals. The response to initial conditions displays the basic inherent dynamic behavior of the system, and the response to input signals displays the response character of the system to forced inputs that emulate physically realistic conditions.

### Step input

In physical systems, the input can be changed suddenly. Ideally in these instances, the input signal has zero rise time relative to the dynamic response time of the system.

| Input | Function | Description | Sketch |
| - | - | - | - |
| Step | $u(t)$ | $\begin{aligned} u(t) = \begin{cases} 0 & t < 0\\ u_0 & t \geq 0 \end{cases} \end{aligned}$ | <img style="width:128px;border:4px solid #9146ff;border-radius:12px" src="./assets/typical-inputs/step-input.png"> |

However in real systems, the input is changed by some other dynamic system with a finite response time. Therefore, the input signal does not have zero rise time relative to the dynamic response time of the system.

In these instances, the input signal is modelled as a *ramped step input*, where the input rises like a ramp for some time, and stays constant thereafter.

$$
\begin{aligned}
u(t) =
\begin{cases}
0 & t < 0 \\
\frac{u_0}{T_1}t & 0 \leq t \leq T_1 \\
u_0 & t > T_1
\end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Ramp input

In physical systems, the input can rise constantly from zero. Ideally in these instances, the input signal increases as a linear function of time. This ramp signal can be considered the integral of the step signal.

| Input | Function | Description | Sketch |
| - | - | - | - |
| Ramp | $tu(t)$ | $\begin{aligned} tu(t) = \begin{cases} 0 & t < 0\\ u_0 t & t \geq 0 \end{cases} \end{aligned}$ | <img style="width:128px;border:4px solid #9146ff;border-radius:12px" src="./assets/typical-inputs/ramp-input.png"> |

However, in real systems, the input signal can not keep rising forever, since energy is a finite resource. In these instances, the input signal is modelled as a *sawtooth wave*, where the input rises like a ramp for some time, falls to zero, and rises again.

### Impulse input

The derivative of the step function is called the *impulse input*. An impulse input $\delta(t)$ is a function whose value is zero everywhere except at zero, and whose integral over the entire real line is equal to some constant.

| Input | Function | Description | Sketch |
| - | - | - | - |
| Impulse | $\delta(t)$ | $\begin{aligned} \delta(t) = \begin{cases} 0 & t \not= 0\\ \infty & t = 0 \end{cases} \end{aligned} \\ \int^{0^+}_{0^-}{\delta(t)}dt = u_0$ | <img style="width:128px;border:4px solid #9146ff;border-radius:12px" src="./assets/typical-inputs/impulse-input.png"> |

However, in real systems, the input signal can not be a pure impulse signal, since that requires an infinite value of the input variable for zero duration of time. In these instances, the input is modelled as a *pulse input*, where the input is constant at some finite value for some finite nonzero duration of time.

The pulse input can be considered an impulse signal if the duration is very small compared to the dynamic response time of the system.

$$
\begin{aligned}
u(t) =
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{$t > 0$ or $t > T_1$} \\
u_0 & 0 \leq t \leq T_1
\end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Harmonic input

In physical systems, the input signal can oscillate at some amplitude. These sinusoidal waves are used to test for the system's *frequency response*, which describes how the system will respond to sinusoidal waves of various frequencies.

If the system's *transient response* is to be tested, the input signal would be zero and the sinusoidal wave would start at $t = 0$.

| Input | Function | Description | Sketch |
| - | - | - | - |
| Sinusoidal | $\sin{\omega t}$ | $\begin{aligned} \sin{\omega t} = \begin{cases} 0 & t < 0 \\ u_0 \sin{\omega t} & t \geq 0\end{cases} \end{aligned}$ | <img style="width:128px;border:4px solid #9146ff;border-radius:12px" src="./assets/typical-inputs/sinusoidal-input.png"> |

If the system's *steady state response* is to be tested, the input signal would be provided to the system for some time duration, and the system response would be observed after the transients have died away.

## Control Systems

### Definition

A control system 

A control system automatically adjusts the output to match a desired value, set through the input.

- the input signal represents the desired output value, called the set point
- the input transducer which converts the input to a form required by the controller.
- the controller which drives the process
- the output of the process, called the process variable
- the output transducer which measures the process variable
- The disturbances are added to the controller and process outputs via summing junctions
- the input is also called the reference
- the output is also called the controller variable

Control systems have the following advantages:

- Power amplification
- Remote control
- Convenience of input form
- Compensation for disturbances

### System configurations

There are two major configurations of control systems: *open loop* and *closed loop*.

#### Open loop systems

<div style="display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;margin:24px">
<img style="width:512px;border:4px solid #9146ff;border-radius:12px" src="./assets/system-configurations/open-loop.png">
</div>

In open loop system, the control action of the controller is independent of the process output.

In closed loop system, the control action of the controller is dependent on the process output. A closed loop system has a feedback loop which ensures the controller exerts a control action to give a process output the same as the reference input or set point.

#### Closed loop systems

The first summing junction algebraically adds the signal from the input to the signal from the output, which arrives via the *feedback path*, the return path from the output to the summing junction. The result is generally called the *actuating signal*. However, in systems where both the input and output transducers have *unity gain* (that is, the transducer amplifies the input by unity), the actuating signal's value is equal to the actual difference between the input and the output. Under this condition, the actuating signal is called the *error*.

<div style="display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;margin:24px">
<img style="width:512px;border:4px solid #9146ff;border-radius:12px" src="./assets/system-configurations/closed-loop.png">
</div>

The closed loop system compensates for disturbances by measuring the output response, feeding that measurement back through a feedback path, and comparing that response to the input at the summing junction.

### Characteristics



## Miscellaneous

### Mathematical models

Mathematical models describes the dynamic behavior of physical systems by ordinary differential equations. Linearization approximations allows to use Laplace methods on nonlinear systems. The transfer functions are organized into block diagrams or signal flow graphs to graphically depict the interconnections. 

### PID controller

A proportional-integral-derivative controller (PID controller) is a control loop mechanism that continuously calculates an error value $e(t)$ as the difference between a desired set point $\text{SP} = r(t)$ and a measured process variable $\text{PV} = y(t)$, and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms. The controller attempts to minimize the error over time by adjusting the control variable $u(t)$ to a new value determined by the weighted sum of the control sums.

<div style="display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;margin:24px">
<img style="width:512px;border:4px solid #9146ff;border-radius:12px" src="./assets/misc/pid-controller.png">
</div>

In this model:

- Term **P** is proportional to the current value of the error $e(t) = r(t) - y(t)$ with $K_p$ as the gain factor. Using proportional control alone will result in an error between the set point and the process value because the controller requires an error to generate the proportional output response.
- Term **I** accounts for past values of the error by integrating the error over time with $K_i$ as the gain factor. The integral term seeks to eliminate the residual error from the application of the proportional control, by adding a control effect due to the historic cumulative value of the error. Therefore, the proportional effect diminishes as the error decreases, but this is compensated by the growing integral effect.
- Term **D** is a best estimate of the future trend of the error, based on its current rate of change, with $K_d$ as the gain factor. If the rate of change is high, the controlling or damping effect is also high due to the large derivative term.

$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{PID control function}
u(t) = K_p e(t) + K_i \int^{t}_{0} e(\tau) d\tau + K_d \frac{d e(t)}{dt}
\end{equation}
$$
