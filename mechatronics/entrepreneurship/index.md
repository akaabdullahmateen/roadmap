# Entrepreneurship

## Introduction to Entrepreneurship

<!-- Global Entrepreneurship Monitor -->

The report published by Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) shows that the highest rate of entrepreneurial start-up activities occur in low-income countries, where good jobs are not plentiful. The majority of people in high-income countries are drawn to entrepreneurship to take advantage of attractive opportunities, whereas in low-income countries, people are drawn to entrepreneurship because of necessity resulting from a lack of career prospects.

<!-- Myth: Majority of New Businesses Fail -->

A popular belief that majority of new businesses fail is simply not true. The often used statistics that 9 out of 10 businesses fail in their first year is an exaggeration. According to Brian Headd, after four years 50 percent of new businesses are still open, 33 percent have failed, and 17 percent are closed but where considered to be successful by their owners.

The 33 percent of startups that fail show that a motivation to start a business is not enough, it must be coupled with a solid business idea, good financial management, and effective execution to maximize chances for success.

### What is Entrepreneurship

<!-- Definition of Entrepreneurship -->

Entrepreneurship is defined as the process by which individuals pursue opportunities without regard to resources they control. It typically requires creativity, drive, and a willingness to take risks. Although, entrepreneurship is usually focused on entrepreneurs starting a new business, established firms can also behave entrepreneurially.

<!-- Corporate Entrepreneurship -->

Established firms with an orientation to acting entrepreneurially practice corporate entrepreneurship. All firms fall along a conceptual continuum that ranges from highly conservative to highly entrepreneurial. The position of a firm on this continuum is referred to as its entrepreneurial intensity. Entrepreneurial firms are typically proactive, innovative, and not averse to taking calculated risks. In contrast, conservative firms take a more "wait and see" posture, and are less innovative and risk averse.

### Why Become an Entrepreneur

The three primary reasons that people become entrepreneurs and start their own firms are to be their own boss, pursue their ideas, and realize financial rewards.

Be Their Own Boss
: This reason is given most commonly. Many entrepreneurs wants to be their own boss because either they have had a long-time ambition to own their own firm or because they have become frustrated working in traditional jobs. Sometimes the desire to be their own boss results from a realization that the only way they will achieve an important personal or professional goal is to start their own business.

Pursue Their Own Ideas
: The second reason people start their own firms is to pursue their own ideas. Some people, when they recognize ideas for new products or services that are not available in the marketplace, have a desire to see those ideas realized. If the idea is viable enough to support a business, they commit tremendous time and energy to convert the idea into a part-time or full-time firm.

Pursue Financial Rewards
: Finally, people start their own firms to pursue financial rewards. However, the average entrepreneur does not make more money than someone with a similar amount of responsibility in a traditional job. Making a profit and increasing the value of a company is a solidifying goal that people can rally around. However, some entrepreneurs even report that the financial rewards associated with entrepreneurship can be bittersweet if they are accompanied by losing control of their firm.

### Characteristics of Successful Entrepreneurs

Several characteristics common to successful entrepreneurs are described below.

Passion for the Business
: The most important characteristic shared by successful entrepreneurs is a passion for their business, whether it is in the context of a new firm or an existing business. This passion typically stems from the entrepreneur's belief that the business will positively impact people's lives. There are five primary reasons for the need of passion, as reflected in the table below.
