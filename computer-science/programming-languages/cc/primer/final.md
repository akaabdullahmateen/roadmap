## Data types

A *data type* (or simply a *type*) is a description of a set of values that dictate the set of allowed operations on those values and how those operations are interpreted.

In C++, objects, references, functions (including template specializations), and expressions have a property called *type*, which both restricts the operations that are permitted for those entities and provides semantic meaning to the otherwise generic sequences of bits.

## Type classification

The C++ type system classifies each type as either a *fundamental type* or a *compound type*. A *fundamental type* is a type that is predefined in the C++ language; whereas, a *compound type* is a type that is defined in terms of another type. The C++ type system consists of the following types:

- Fundamental types
    - Void type (`void`)
    - Null pointer type (`nullptr_t`)
    - Arithmetic types
        - Integral types
            - Boolean type (`bool`)
            - Character types

## Fundamental types

### Character types

Basic character type
: The basic character type (`char`) is a type for character representation. It is a distinct type that has an implementation-defined choice of `signed char` or `unsigned char` as its underlying type.

  The signedness depends on the efficiency of processing of character processing on the target system (the default for ARM and PowerPC is usually `unsigned char`, and the default for x86 and x64 is usually `signed char`). For every value of type `unsigned char` in range: [0, 255], converting the value to `char` and then back to `unsigned char` produces the original value.

Signed and unsigned character types
: The signed character type (`signed char`) is a type for signed character representation. The unsigned character type (`unsigned char`) is a type for unsigned character representation; it is often used to inspect object representations (raw memory).

Wide character type
: The wide character type (`wchar_t`) is a type for wide character representation. It has an implementation-defined choice of signed or unsigned integer type as its underlying type. The values of type `wchar_t` can represent distinct codes for all members of the largest extended character set specified among the supported locales.

  It has the same size, signedness, and alignment as one of the integer types, but is a distinct type. In practice, it is 32 bits and holds UTF-32 code units on Linux and many other non-Windows systems, but 16 bit and holds UTF-16 code units on Windows.

Fixed-width character types
: The fixed-width character types (`char8_t`, `char16_t`, and `char32_t`) are types for Unicode character representations, required to be large enough to represent any code unit from the specified format. Although, they have the same object representation, value representation, and alignment requirements as their equivalent types, they are distinct types.

  | Type       | Format | Equivalent type  |
  | ---------- | ------ | ---------------- |
  | `char8_t`  | UTF-8  | `unsigned char`  |
  | `char16_t` | UTF-16 | `uint_least16_t` |
  | `char32_t` | UTF-32 | `uint_least32_t` |

### Integer types

The integer types includes the *standard integer types* and implementation-defined *extended integer types*. The *standard integer types* includes the five *standard signed integer types* and five corresponding *standard unsigned integer types*.

Signed integer types
: The *standard signed integer types* along with their minimum width constraints are specified in the table below. The width (`N`) of a signed integer type is implementation-defined, but must be at least the minimum width specified for that integer type, and must be at least equal to the width of the preceding type.

  | Type            | Minimum width |
  | --------------- | ------------- |
  | `signed char`   | 8             |
  | `short int`     | 16            |
  | `int`           | 16            |
  | `long int`      | 32            |
  | `long long int` | 64            |

Unsigned integer types
: For each of the standard signed integer type, there exists a corresponding (but distinct) *standard unsigned integer type*. An unsigned integer type has the same width (`N`), object representation, value representation, and alignment requirements, as the corresponding signed integer type; but the range of representable values is different.

  | Integer type          | Minimum value    | Maximum value       |
  | --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
  | Signed integer type   | -2<sup>N-1</sup> | 2<sup>N-1</sup> - 1 |
  | Unsigned integer type | 0                | 2<sup>N</sup> - 1   |

Overflow
: Overflow for signed integer type yield undefined behavior. Unsigned integer types do not overflow; instead, the arithmetic is performed module 2<sup>N</sup>.

Value representation
: For each value `x` of a signed integer type, the value of the corresponding unsigned integer type congruent to `x` module 2<sup>N</sup> has the same value of corresponding bits in its value representation. This is also known as 2's complement representation.

  Each value `x` of an unsigned integer type with width `N` has a unique representation: x = x<sub>0</sub>2<sup>0</sup> + x<sub>1</sub>2<sup>1</sup> + ... + x<sub>N-1</sub>2<sup>N-1</sup>, where each coefficient of `x` is either `0` or `1`; this is called base-2 representation of `x`. The base-2 representation of a value of signed integer type is the base-2 representation of the congruent value of the corresponding unsigned integer type.

Modifiers
: The basic integer type (`int`) is intended to have the natural width suggested by the architecture of the execution environment; the other signed and unsigned integer types are provided to meet special needs. These other signed and unsigned integer types can be viewed as the basic integer type (`int`) with modifiers for signedness and size.

  These modifiers are listed in the table below, and can appear in any order, but only one from each category can be present in a type name. If no size modifiers are present, then one of the signedness modifiers must be present; in which case, the type is equivalent to the basic integer type (either `signed int` or `unsigned int`). If no signedness modifiers are present, then one of the size modifiers must be present; in which case, the type is equivalent to the unsigned integer type (either `short`, `int`, `long`, or `long long`).

  | Modifier    | Category   | Description                                     |
  | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
  | `signed`    | Signedness | Target type will have signed representation     |
  | `unsigned`  | Signedness | Target type will have unsigned representation   |
  | `short`     | Size       | Target type will have width of at least 16 bits |
  | `long`      | Size       | Target type will have width of at least 32 bits |
  | `long long` | Size       | Target type will have width of at least 64 bits |

### Floating-point types

Types
: Single precision floating-point type:
  : The single-precision floating-point type (`float`) matches the IEEE-754 binary32 format.

  Double precision floating-point type:
  : The double-precision floating-point type (`double`) matches the IEEE-754 binary64 format. It provides at least as much precision as `float`, and at least as much range as `float`.

  Extended precision floating-point type:
  : The extended precision floating-point type (`long double`) matches either the IEEE-754 binary128 format, IEEE-754 binary64-extended format, non-IEEE-754 extended format, or IEEE-754 binary64 format (in decreasing preference order), depending on the supported formats of the implementation. It provides at least as much precision as `double`, and at least as much range as `double`.

Special values
: Floating-point types may support special values:

  Infinity
  : The macro `INFINITY` expands to constant expression of type `float` which evaluates to positive or unsigned infinity, if the implementation supports floating-point infinities; otherwise, it expands to a positive value that is guaranteed to overflow a `float` at compile time, and the use of this macro generates a compiler warning.

  Negative zero
  : The negative zero compares equal to positive zero, but is meaningful in some mathematics (such as when `1.0/0.0 == INFINITY` but `1.0/-0.0 == -INFINITY`).

  NaN
  : The special value, NaN (not-a-number), does not compare equal with anything, including itself. Multiple bit patterns represent NaN (such as `std::nan` and `NAN`). Note that C++ takes no special notice of signaling NaN other than detecting their support by `std::numeric_limits::has_signaling_NaN`, and treats all NaN as quiet.

### Miscellaneous types

Void type
: The void type (`void`) is a type with an empty set of values. It is an incomplete type that can not be completed; consequently, objects of type `void` are disallowed. There are no arrays of `void`, nor references to `void`. However, pointers to `void` and functions returning `void` are permitted.

Null pointer type
: The null pointer type (`nullptr_t`) is the type of the null pointer literal (`nullptr`). It is a distinct type that is not itself a pointer type or a pointer to member type. Its values are null pointer constant (`NULL`), and may be implicitly converted to any pointer type or pointer to member type.

Boolean type
: The boolean type (`bool`) is a distinct type that has one of the two values: `true` and `false`. It has the same object representation, value representation, and alignment requirements as an implementation-defined unsigned integer type.

Typedef names of the form `intN_t` may only be defined if the implementation supports an integer type of that exact width with no padding bits.

Fixed width floating-point types
: | Type              | Literal suffix   | Width | Precision bits | Exponent bits | Max exponent |
  | ----------------- | ---------------- | ----- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
  | `std::float16_t`  | `f16` or `F16`   | 16    | 11             | 5             | 15           |
  | `std::float32_t`  | `f32` or `F32`   | 32    | 24             | 8             | 127          |

  !!! note

      Unlike the fixed width integer types, which may be aliases to standard integer types, the fixed width floating-point types must be aliases to extended floating-point types (not `float`, `double`, or `long double`).

### Properties

Data models
: The choices made by each implementation about the sizes of the fundamental types are collectively known as a *data model*. Four data models are widely accepted:

  | Data model             | System architecture | `int` width | `long` width | `ptr` width | Used by                       |
  | ---------------------- | ------------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----------------------------- |
  | **LP32** or **2/4/4**  | 32-bit              | 16          | 32           | 32          | Win16 API                     |
  | **ILP32** or **4/4/4** | 32-bit              | 32          | 32           | 32          | Win32 API, Unix, Linux, macOS |
  | **LLP64** or **4/4/8** | 64-bit              | 32          | 32           | 64          | Wind64 API                    |
  | **LP64** or **4/8/8**  | 64-bit              | 32          | 64           | 64          | Unix, Linux, macOS            |
  | **ILP64** or **8/8/8** | 64-bit              | 64          | 64           | 64          | UNICOX on Cray                |

  The following table summarizes all standard integer types and their widths in common data models:

  | Type specifier           | Equivalent type      | Minimum width | LP32 | ILP32 | LLP64 | LP64 |
  | ------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ---- |

Range of values
: The following table provides a reference for approximate limits of common numeric representations. Since, these limits depend on the exact width (`N`) of the type, which are implementation-defined; the table uses generic types with common implementation-defined widths and formats, rather than the standard fundamental types.

  !!! note
      Prior to C++20, the C++ Standard allowed any signed integer representation, and the minimum guaranteed range of a signed integer was from -2<sup>N-1</sup> + 1 to +2<sup>N-1</sup> - 1, which corresponds to the limits of one's complement. However, all C++ compilers use two's complement representation, and as of C++20, it is the only representation allowed by the standard, with the guaranteed range from -2<sup>N-1</sup> to +2<sup>N-1</sup> - 1.
